        <p>In 2019, the department of Information Science & Engineering (ISE) collaborated with ICT Academy to offer industry-based 
            courses like Google (for Cloud and Android courses), and UiPath (for Robotic Process Automation course). Since 2020, 
            ISE is part of Google’s Career Readiness Program. Department has a high placement rate with attractive packages and has 
            a high-end NVIDIA server to explore more into data analytics and also has qualified and supportive faculty to cater to 
            the needs of the aspiring students and upgrade their skills.</p>
        <p>The Department has excellent placement track record in reputed industries with an average of 80 – 85% placement of
             eligible students over the years. The Department regularly conducts audit courses, and special courses on advanced 
             topics, to bridge the gap between the curriculum and the need of the industry. The Department offers M.Tech programs 
             in Information Science & Engineering and in Software Engineering (autonomous under VTU) from the academic year 2003-04 and
              2015-16 respectively. From the year 2022-23 M.Tech program is under Nitte University.</p>
